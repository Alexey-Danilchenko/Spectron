# Light Sources

The Spectron 2 project uses a wideband light source component as an input to the monochromator. Several light sources with full visible spectrum coverage were evaluated, built and tested for this project. It is important to realize that flat spectrum is not necessary in this application. What is required from a light source is continuous spectrum, with no gaps. Evaluated light sources are all satisfy this criteria. Below is the list of the light sources chosen as a result of this evaluation:

* [LED light source](LEDs) - greater stability and control, this is the preferred light source for Spectron 2 project.
* [Pulsed Xenon short arc light source](Xenon) - great visible spectrum coverage, compact package and point light source best suited to guide light to the monochromator.
